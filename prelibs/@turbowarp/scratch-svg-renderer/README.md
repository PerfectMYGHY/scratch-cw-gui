[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/LLK/scratch-svg-renderer.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
A class built for importing SVGs into [Scratch](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui). Imports an SVG string to a DOM element or an HTML canvas. Handles some of the quirks with Scratch 2.0 SVGs, which sometimes misreport their width, height and view box.

## Installation
This requires you to have Git and Node.js installed.

To install as a dependency for your own application:
```bash
npm install scratch-svg-renderer
```
To set up a development environment to edit scratch-svg-renderer yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-svg-renderer.git
cd scratch-svg-renderer
npm install
```

## How to include in a Node.js App
```js
import SvgRenderer from 'scratch-svg-renderer';

const svgRenderer = new SvgRenderer();

const svgData = "<svg>...</svg>";
const scale = 1;
const quirksMode = false; // If true, emulate Scratch 2.0 SVG rendering "quirks"
function doSomethingWith(canvas) {...};

svgRenderer.loadSVG(svgData, quirksMode, () => {
	svgRenderer.draw(scale);
	doSomethingWith(svgRenderer.canvas);
});
```

## Committing

This project uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to ensure version bumps
follow semver so that projects depending on it don't break unexpectedly.

In order to automatically determine version updates, semantic release expects commit messages to follow the
[conventional-changelog](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md)
specification.

You can use the [commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to make commits formatted in this way:

```bash
npm install -g commitizen@latest cz-conventional-changelog@latest
```

Now you're ready to make commits using `git cz`.
